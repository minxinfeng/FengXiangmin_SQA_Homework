The Homework for Week 2 By Feng Xiangmin (冯祥敏13126069)
## Chapter 4 ##
This chapter is mainly introduce the why QA is so important and tell the QA processes in different models. As well as the defects and V&V model.

Defect handling is an integral part of QA activities, and different QA alternatives and related activities can be viewed as a concerted effort to ensure software quality. These activities can be integrated into software development and maintenance processes as an integral part of the overall process activities, typically in the following fashion:

- Testing is an integral part of any development process, forming an important link in the overall development chain.
- Quality reviews or inspections often accompany the transition from one phase or development activity to another.
- Various defect prevention activities are typically carried out in the early stages.
- Defect containment activities typically focus on the later, operational part of the development process, although their planning and implementation need to be carried out throughout the development process.

These QA activities can also be partitioned into verification and validation (V&V) activities using a bi-partite classification scheme in the so-called V&V view. Similarly, they can be partitioned by the generic way they employ to deal with errors, faults, or failures as different defect-centered (DC) activities using our tri-partite classification scheme in the so-call DC view. Both views and both classification schemes have their useful purposes and implications. Our tri-partite classification provides a balanced and systematic scheme to organize and classify existing software QA activities. It can also be easily mapped to the commonly used bi-partite scheme of validation and verification activities. Consequently, we will follow this classification in the rest of the book without losing the generality associated with the other commonly used views of QA activities.

## Chapter 5 ##
To manage the quality assurance (QA) activities and to provide realistic opportunities of quantifiable quality improvement, we need to go beyond QA to perform the following:

- Qualities planning before specific QA activities are carried out, in the so-called pre-QA activities in software quality engineering. We need to set the overall quality goal by managing customer’s quality expectations under the project cost and budgetary constraints. We also need to select specific QA alternatives and techniques to implement as well as measurement and models to provide project monitoring and qualitative feedback.
- Quality quantification and improvement through measurement, analysis, feedback, and follow-up activities. These activities need to be carried out after the start of specific QA activities, in the so-called post-QA activities in software quality engineering. The analyses would provide us with quantitative assessment of product quality, and identification of improvement opportunities. The follow-up actions would implement these qualities and process improvement initiatives and help us achieve quantifiable quality improvement.

The integration of these activities with the QA activities forms our software quality engineering process, which can also be integrated into the overall software development and maintenance process.

## Chapter 6 ##
This chapter introduce the basic concepts of testing and examined various questions and issues related to testing. In addition, classified the major testing techniques by two important criteria:

- Functional vs. structural testing techniques, with the former focusing on external functional behavior, the latter on internal implementations. Alternatively, they can be characterized by the ignorance or knowledge of implementation details: Functional testing is also referred to as black-box testing (BBT) because it ignores all implementation details, while structural testing is also referred to as white-box testing (WBT) because the transparent system boundary allows implementation details to be visible and to be used in testing.
- Usage-based vs. coverage-based stopping criteria and corresponding testing techniques, with the former attempting to reach certain reliability goals by focusing on functions and feature frequently used by target customers, and the latter focusing on attaining certain coverage levels defined internally.
